# WP2_Data_cubes

This repository contains the data cubes used by the Work Package 2 (WP2) of the Innovative Trainig Network BiD4BESt (https://www.bid4best.org/).

J094521.fits is the data cube of the source SDSS J094521.33+173753.2, a Type-2 quasar observed with NIFS at the Gemini Noth Observatory.
J094521_stat.fits is the corresponding error cube.

The analysis of these data has been published: https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/09/aa43585-22.pdf. In the paper all the details on the data reduction and analysis are provided with a discussion on the results and the conlcusions.

'Comparison_literature.pdf' shows the comparison between the results from the source cited above and the literature, especially with Fiore et al. 2017 and Musiimenta et al. (submitted).

'ionizedoutflow_radio.pdf' shows the ionized outflow emission in SDSS J094521.33+173753.2 compared with its radio emission (more details in the published work).
